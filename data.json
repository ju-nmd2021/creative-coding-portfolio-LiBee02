    "description": "This project centers around random circles and rectangles going to war on the canvas. There is a 50/50 change of creating a circle or rectangle, making a messy, colorful artwork that changes every time you reresh the website. First i created the canvas, with a random background color ranging from rgb 0-255. Then I decided to put some objects on the canvas, starting with circles in different shapes. I decided that it looked too boring with just white circles, so I did the same as for the background and added random color values to each circle. To make each circle unique and placed randomly, I created a 30/30 grid of shapes, the i in the function calculated the horizontal placement and j for the vertical, all placed between 0-30 in the grid. I also calculated the x and y coordinates for the circles center, making each cirle placing random. The size is also random, due to the diameter of each circle being on a scale from 20-40. All of this was then drawn in the ellipse function. After this, the artwork still looked plain, so I added an else boolen that created random rectangles with the same random attributes as for the circles. I made it so that the rectangles and circles are drawn at a 50/50 chance, creating a chaotic artwork. ",
